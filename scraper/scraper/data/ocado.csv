Eliminate unpleasant odours with a fresh, long-lasting Marine fragrance that you’ll want to splash your feathers in. (Although for non-feathered humans that is certainly not recommended. Or so I’m told to say). Toilet cleaning isn't rocket science, it's Duck® Science.""",Netherlands,"""Duck""","""SC Johnson Ltd.,
